# Manufacturing Line Productivity Analysis
Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze manufacturing line productivity by identifying key inefficiencies, understanding downtime trends, and evaluating operator performance. Unplanned downtime in a manufacturing environment can lead to significant financial losses, decreased efficiency, and disruptions in production. This analysis provides a data-driven approach to uncover patterns and optimize operations.

# Tools & Technologies Used
Microsoft Excel: Used for data collection, preprocessing, and initial exploratory analysis. This included cleaning raw data, handling missing values, and structuring it for visualization.
Power BI: Utilized for building an interactive dashboard that enables real-time insights into downtime trends, operator performance, and product-based inefficiencies.
Key Analysis Areas & Insights
Downtime Trends Over Time

The dashboard visualizes downtime trends over different months to identify fluctuations and recurring patterns.
A bar chart compares downtime duration across months, helping stakeholders assess whether downtime is increasing or decreasing over time.
Downtime by Product

A pie chart displays the percentage of total downtime attributed to different products.
This allows production managers to identify which products contribute most to downtime and investigate potential reasons (e.g., machine failures, supply chain delays, or quality issues).
Operator Performance & Downtime Impact

A stacked bar chart categorizes downtime based on operators.
This provides insights into how different operators impact productivity, highlighting potential training needs or workflow improvements.
Operator Error Downtime

A KPI card presents the total downtime attributed to operator errors, allowing for targeted interventions such as additional training or process optimization.
Purpose & Business Impact
The ultimate goal of this analysis is to provide actionable insights that manufacturing managers can use to:

Reduce unplanned downtime by identifying key problem areas.
Optimize operator efficiency and improve workforce training programs.
Enhance product performance by addressing frequent failure points.
Improve overall production efficiency, leading to cost savings and higher output.
By leveraging Excel and Power BI, this project transforms raw manufacturing data into meaningful visual insights that drive informed decision-making, helping businesses improve efficiency and reduce production losses.
